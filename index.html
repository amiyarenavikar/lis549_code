    <h1>Tokio</h1>
    <p class="p">
        Tokio is one of the main protagonists and narrator of the Spanish Netflix series <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Heist">Money Heist</a></cite>  
        <br>

        <br>
        I like this character because:
        <ul>
            <li class="highlighted">Tokio is entirely reckless and impulsive and knows how to live in the moment.</li>
            <li>She is very expressive with her emotions and is not afraid to take on a challenge.</li>
            <li>Although she sometimes makes bad, even worse decisions, she deeply cares about the 
                people she loves.
            </li>
        </ul>
