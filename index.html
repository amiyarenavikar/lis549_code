        I like this character because:
        <ul>
            <li>Tokio is entirely reckless and impulsive and knows how to live in the moment.</li>
            <li>She is very expressive with her emotions and is not afraid to take on a challenge.</li>
            <li>Although she sometimes makes bad, even worse decisions, she deeply cares about the 
                people she loves.
            </li>
        </ul>
